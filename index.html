      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Goshen Foundation is a bold, faith-driven initiative founded by Victor Mudenyo in Webuye, Kenya. We exist to empower unprivileged children through football, education, and spiritual mentorship. Our mission is to create a safe place — a modern-day Goshen — where children can thrive, dream, and grow into leaders.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Inspired by the biblical land of Goshen, our foundation began with visits to orphanages and communities where children lacked hope and opportunity. Through sports and discipleship, we’ve seen lives transformed — from street survival to structured mentorship. Goshen is a movement of restoration, purpose, and faith.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
      <p>We believe in the power of God’s love to heal, guide, and uplift. Our foundation is rooted in Scripture and the teachings of Jesus Christ. We believe every child is born with purpose and deserves the chance to discover it through mentorship, discipline, and community.</p>
